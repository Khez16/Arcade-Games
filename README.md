### Project Description:
The project is currently a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that allows users to play against one another. When users access the website, they are taken to a page that displays “Arcade Games''. They are prompted to choose either “Player 1”, “Player 2”, “Computer” or click on the “About” page to view the creators of the webpage.
In the “Computer” option, the user can play against a Computer. The Computer randomly selects one of the options. When playing against the computer it displays the default message “I’ve done 10000 calculations and in none of them, do you win. Yet You Think You Can Defeat Me?” We can also chat with the computer, however the API does not work. We use an API to achieve this.
Once the user chooses a player, they are then redirected to a page where the game will start. On this page, the user can view the game page where they are prompted with three different options; Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
On the top side of the screen, we have a scorecard that keeps track of each of the players' scores (in blue and red borders). We chose an 8-bit theme and it displays the font as such.
On the left side of the screen, we have the current player’s turn in a yellow border. This border updates as the player who has yet to play their turn is displayed.
On the right side of the screen we implemented a game chat that allows the 2 players to chat with each other. It is titled “Game Chat” , and it allows the players to chat. The players can play as they wish, and they can always click on the back button to return to the homepage.
